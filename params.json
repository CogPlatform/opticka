It is designed to work on OS X, Windows (currently no digital I/O) or Linux, and interfaces via strobed words and ethernet with a Plexon Omniplex for recording neurophysiological data. The various classes can also be used without the need to run the GUI, and stimuli provide a unified interface (setup, animate,draw, update)  to integrate into standard PTB routines.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i42.tinypic.com/10ypeua.png)\r\n\r\nQuick Documentation\r\n===================\r\nruntest.m is a self-documenting minimal toy example showing a bunch of different stimuli. Read the auto-generated HTML for runtest.m here:\r\n[runtest.m ](http://144.82.131.18/optickadocs/runtest.html)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n=========\r\n * Values are always given in eye-relevant co-ordinates (degrees etc.) that are internally calculated based on screen geometry/distance\r\n * No limit on the number of independent variables, and variables can be linked to multiple stimuli.\r\n * Number of heterogeneous stimuli displayed simultaneously only limited by the GPU / computer power.\r\n * Display lists are used, so one can easily change drawing order (i.e. what stimulus draws over other stimuli), by changing its order on the list.\r\n * Object Oriented, allowing stimulus classes to be easily added and code to autodocument using DOxygen.\r\n * The set of stimuli and variables can be saved into protocol files, to easily run successive protocols quickly.\r\n * Fairly comprehensive control of the PTB interface to the drawing hardware, like blending mode, bit depth, windowing, verbosity.\r\n * Colour is defined in floating point format, takes advantage of higher bit depths in newer graphics cards when available. The buffer can be defined from 8-32bits, use full alpha blending within that space and enable a >8bit output using pseudogrey bitstealing techniques.\r\n * Sub-pixel precision (1/256th pixel) for movement and positioning.\r\n * TTL output to data acquisition and other devices. Currently uses LabJack to interface to the Plexon Omniplex using strobed words.\r\n * Can talk to other machines on the network during display using TCP/UDP (used to control Plexon online display, so one can see PSTHs for each stimulus variable shown in real time).\r\n * Each stimulus has its own relative X & Y position, and the screen centre can be arbitrarily moved via the GUI.\r\n * Can record stimuli to video files.\r\n * Manages monitor calibration using ColorCalII. Calibration sets can be saved and loaded easily via the GUI.\r\n * Gratings:\r\n       * Per-frame update of properties for arbitrary numbers of grating patches.\r\n       * Rectangular or circular aperture.\r\n       * Cosine or hermite interpolation for filtering grating edges.\r\n       * Square wave gratings\r\n       * Gabors\r\n * Coherent dot stimuli, coherence expressed from 0-1. Either square or round dots. Colours can be simple, random, random luminance or binary. Kill rates allow random replacement rates for dots. Circular aperture option.\r\n * Bars, either solid colour or random noise texture. Bars can be animated, direction can be independent of their angle.\r\n * Flashing/pulsing spots.\r\n * Pictures/Images that can drift and rotate.\r\n * Hand-mapping module - use mouse controlled dynamic bar / texture / colour to handmap receptive fields; includes logging of clicked position and later printout / storage of hand maps. These maps are in screen co-ordinates for quick subsequent stimulus placement.","google":""}
